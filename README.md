#### C - Simple Shell
The shell is a command line interface (CLI) program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.
The C shell is an interactive command interpreter and a command programming language. It uses syntax that is similar to the C programming language. The csh command starts the C shell. When you log in, the csh command first searches the system-wide setup file /etc/csh.
